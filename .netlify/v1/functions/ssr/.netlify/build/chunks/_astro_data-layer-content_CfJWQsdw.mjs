Whether you're building a decentralized app, a blockchain-based company, or a digital asset like NFTs, the way people perceive your brand is going to play a massive role in your success. But here's the thing: branding isn't just about logos or color schemes. It's about the whole experience—every interaction someone has with your company, your message, and how your product fits into their world.\n\n### The Evolution of Branding in Web Design\n\nTen to fifteen years ago, web design was all about personality. Each designer and agency had its own recognizable style. Websites weren’t just templates—they were statements. When a site was redesigned, it was exciting. People would flock to check out the new look, often showcasing unique design elements that defined the company's brand.\n\nToday, many websites have become somewhat… well, boring. There’s no denying it. The push towards responsive design—while technically brilliant—has left a lot of creativity in the dust. We’ve grown complacent with frameworks like Bootstrap and ready-made components, and it shows. We're seeing fewer unique and memorable designs today.\n\nBut companies are now responsible for their branding more than ever. What's unique about the Web3 era is that branding is no longer just visual—it's tied into how your decentralized product interacts with the world. How much ownership and freedom does your brand offer? How decentralized is your message?\n\nEvery touchpoint, whether it’s visual, written, or experiential, defines how users perceive a brand in Web3. This mandate of consistency and creativity is challenging, which is why going back to the fundamentals of practical branding is so important.\n\n## Why Design Might be More Boring—But Creativity Is Needed More Than Ever\n\nWhen everyone is using the same tools, the designs start to look the same. Bootstrap, grid patterns, cookie-cutter templates—they're efficient, but they’re also homogenizing the web. While these patterns help with consistency and user experience, too many brands rely on them without injecting anything personal.\n\nEnter Web3 and its demand for differentiation. The decentralized world is inherently about breaking molds. So if the technologies we leverage to create websites are sucking the personality out of them, then we have to find a way to carve out new creative spaces.\n\nThink of it this way: just because a site needs to be mobile-friendly doesn’t mean it can’t have character. If all websites look the same, how are you, as a Web3 brand, supposed to stand out? You need practical, thoughtful branding decisions that go beyond the cookie-cutter mold.\n\n## Practical Branding: More Important Than Your Logo\n\nA brand isn’t just a logo or color scheme. Good design is emotional. It creates connections. In Web3, where everything is decentralized, your brand is the cohesive thread that holds everything together.\n\nCreating an effective brand means looking at every aspect of a customer's interaction with your company, from the visual identity to the tone of voice, the ecosystem you build around social media, and even customer support. Every touchpoint matters.\n\nTake Airbnb, for example. Early on, they made a branding decision to professionally photograph every property. It was costly, but it paid off because it increased trust. They were branding tangible spaces, but the theory applies equally to Web3. Whether you're branding a marketplace for NFTs or a blockchain game, how you map out every user interaction is critical to success.\n\n## A Lazy Layout Process? It's Time to Think Again\n\nOne of the biggest challenges today is that web designers have become lazy with their layout processes. It’s understandable, we’ve been there. Frameworks and templates make things easier, and timelines are tight. But this laziness has a visual cost.\n\nIn the saturated space of Web3, lazy design could mean your brand fades into the background. We can’t rely on just slapping our logo onto whatever template is trending. **We have to create something truly unique**, and that requires going back to the drawing board—re-examining the brand, layout process, and every aspect of design to infuse it with personality.\n\nTrue creativity in design isn’t about layering on flashy effects or balancing fonts—you need to grab attention, communicate clearly, and enhance the user's journey. In the world of decentralized apps and blockchain products, your layout and user interface are more than just aesthetic; they're highly functional ways to express the promise of transparency, ownership, and access that Web3 promises.\n\n## The Role of Social Media in Web3 Branding\n\nOne of the key aspects brands in the Web3 space must focus on is the social ecosystem. Social media isn’t just adding buttons on a page; it requires creating authentic interactions. For Web3 companies, building this trust and connection is especially vital. Whether you're engaging a community on Discord, Twitter, or even decentralized social platforms, **consistent messaging** is paramount.\n\nMany companies have ignored or underestimated the power of consistent social branding, thinking their website alone can carry their brand identity. Instead, every interaction—whether in a tweet, a blog post, or a chatroom—reflects directly on your credibility and authenticity. And users in the Web3 space are highly savvy—they’ll know if your messages feel impersonal or automated.\n\n## Standing Out in the Homogeneous Web\n\nWe need to stop replicating the same trendy designs. The Web3 space is all about individuality, ownership, and creativity, so why isn’t your brand reflecting that?\n\nInstead of relying entirely on trends, Web3 companies need to focus on building **brand equity**. This means sticking to unique visual elements that belong solely to your brand—be it a typeface, color combination, or an illustrative style. Think about how Spotify stands out not just for their sound but for their visual experience. Despite the pressure to follow trends, they’ve bucked the norm where it matters, building a distinct identity. The same must be done in Web3, where competition can be fierce, but standing out is achievable.\n\nLikewise, we can learn from people like Jeffrey Zeldman, who emphasized that even in a framework-heavy web, there’s room for personality and innovation. We need to rekindle that innovator's mindset—dare to design something that's never been done before.\n\n## Bringing Back Purpose: Branding in Web3\n\nFor a Web3 company, **branding must go beyond superficial elements** like logos or trendy design patterns. It requires you to dig deeper and ask important questions:\n\n1. **What story are we telling?**\n2. **What emotion do we want users to feel when they interact with us?**\n3. **How can our design choices reflect our core values?**\n\nThe answers to these questions will help ensure your website doesn’t fall into the cookie-cutter trap. It’s not about competing for beauty; it’s about competing for uniqueness and memorability. The same is true for your tone of voice, whether it's cheeky, direct, or informal. What your users see and feel must reflect the very ethos of decentralization that Web3 thrives on.\n\n## The Takeaway: Redefining Creativity for Web3 Success\n\nThe Web3 world is inherently about **pushing boundaries**, and practical branding is the key to establishing a lasting digital presence. While technical prowess is crucial, it's clear that good design still matters—perhaps more than ever. The decentralization of Web3 means companies must build genuine connections through thoughtful, deliberate branding decisions.\n\nAs we move forward, those who embrace their brand's uniqueness, question the norms, and craft a strong identity will be the ones who thrive in Web3. True innovation will come from those who dare to get off the grid, both in code and design, shaping something that resonates emotionally, visually, and functionally for their audience.\n\n---\n\n**Ready to bring more personality to your Web3 brand?** Start thinking beyond templates, frameworks, and patterns. Get back to the basics of practical, deliberate branding, and you'll stand out from the crowd.","src/content/blog/how-practical-branding-is-critical-to-the-success-of-web3.md","7b06b9ec55d1b6c2",{html:77,metadata:78},"<h3 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h3>\n<p></p><details><summary>Open Table of contents</summary><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#how-practical-branding-is-critical-to-the-success-of-web3\">How Practical Branding Is Critical to the Success of Web3</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#the-evolution-of-branding-in-web-design\">The Evolution of Branding in Web Design</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#why-design-might-be-more-boringbut-creativity-is-needed-more-than-ever\">Why Design Might be More Boring—But Creativity Is Needed More Than Ever</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#practical-branding-more-important-than-your-logo\">Practical Branding: More Important Than Your Logo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#a-lazy-layout-process-its-time-to-think-again\">A Lazy Layout Process?

If we’re willing to admit our mistakes, we create the perfect backdrop for growth and improvement. I’ve had my fair share of failures, but one particular experience while designing an accessible video player opened my eyes to areas I had previously overlooked in Web3 inclusive design.\n\n## Learning from Failure: The Video Player Case Study\n\nI was contracted to build a custom video player that would be an accessibility triumph. The organization that my friend we worked with had a highly specific audience: users who were visually impaired. Our goal was not just to make it \"usable\" for them, but to ensure a truly inclusive and fully accessible experience. We carried our prior successes, our knowledge, and our confidence into the project. But we missed something critical.\n\nWe thought we had created a player that would meet all accessibility standards. Technically, we had. But during the development process—and more importantly, during usability testing—we realized we had crucial gaps. The player was nearly accessible, but it was not _truly_ inclusive.\n\nWhat we learned was humbling but transformation.\n\n## Winning the Contract and Initial Setup\n\nAt the beginning, we had all the right ingredients for success. We won the contract largely because of our deep expertise in assessing and building accessible video players. We had already done detailed audits on various players and knew the technical requirements backwards.\n\nOur plan was to adopt a flexible, agile approach. We’d involve users in multiple phases and run frequent tests throughout development. It sounded like a winning formula, and in theory, it was.\n\nBut soon, our assumptions began to unravel.\n\n## The Missing Controls: A Simple Assumption Gone Wrong\n\nOne of the first decisions we made was to remove fast-forward and rewind buttons, thinking the timeline scrubber would suffice. We believed this choice would reduce clutter, simplifying interactions for screen reader users. It seemed like a small change, but in reality, this decision planted the seeds for a much larger problem.\n\nWhen we pushed the player out for usability testing, users with different disabilities—particularly those using older assistive technology—struggled. Someone testing the player through an older version of a screen reader found that the timeline scrubber wasn’t adjustable. Initially, we were baffled. We’d tested it rigorously in the most current versions. How could this problem have avoided our detection?\n\nWhat we missed was that not every user has access to the latest technology. Some people use outdated versions to navigate the web. So, while the timeline feature was theoretically accessible, it didn’t work for everyone. This was one of those failure moments that hurt the most, especially because we define ourselves as experts in accessibility.\n\n## Low Vision Users: A Missed Design Opportunity\n\nAnother group that we initially overlooked were users with low vision. While the video player passed technical tests, the user experience was clunky for them. A problematic issue? The timeline scrubber. We realized that low-vision users couldn’t easily see the time markers that allowed precise navigation along the timeline. We assumed that moving the video to a specific time would be easy! But that assumption hadn’t considered how users with magnifiers or reduced fields of view engage with screen content.\n\nOne user eloquently described the ordeal: They had to constantly guess where the 10-minute mark might be, move the scrubber, check the time at the left, and adjust again and again. Even with the best technical accessibility in place, the design failed to be intuitive for everyone.\n\n## Redesigning Based on User Feedback\n\nWe heard our users loud and clear. It was time to head back to the drawing board. First, we introduced a better timeline scrubber. We added a function that showed the current time as users moved along the timeline, putting it directly in their field of vision.\n\nAdditionally, fast-forward and rewind buttons made a comeback after we realized how much they mattered, especially for users accustomed to these controls on VCRs and cassette players. It became evident that some users relied on these more than the scrubber. The fact that these buttons were missing caused unnecessary friction.\n\nWhat seemed like small design choices ended up creating major issues. Lesson learned: incremental improvements based on real-time feedback are _vital_ in Web3 design processes. Inclusivity needs to factor into every step, not just the final product test.\n\n## Practicing True Inclusive Design in Web3\n\nOne mistake anyone can make—and we made—is focusing only on technical accessibility. Just because something complies with standards doesn’t mean it’s inclusive. In fact, inclusivity in Web3 design is multi-layered.\n\nThere are two levels of inclusive design:\n\n1. **Inclusion in the product.** This is what we commonly refer to as 'accessible design.' It ensures that people with disabilities can use the product.\n2. **Inclusion in the process.** This means involving users with disabilities as co-designers, not just testers. Specifically, including their experiences while crafting the solution ensures that we understand their needs on a deeper level.\n\nTrue inclusion means engaging the actual users—people with disabilities—in the ideation, early design, and testing process. This isn’t just about ticking an accessibility box but creating innovations that _work_ for everyone, _from the get-go_.\n\n## Moving from \"Accessibility by Luck\" to Intentional Inclusion\n\nA common trap in the Web3 design world is creating an accessible product entirely by chance—happy accidents, if you will. Your design shouldn’t accidentally work for disabled users; it should intentionally meet their needs.\n\nIn our case, designing an accessible player wasn’t enough. We didn’t properly consult people with disabilities early in the process to inform the design better. Those missteps led to an inaccessible experience, even if it passed technical guidelines.\n\nIn Web3, where decentralized and innovative platforms are rising, accessible design must move beyond mere compliance. Inclusivity has to be _intentional_.\n\n## Shifting Left: Including Users Earlier in the Process\n\nIn typical Web3 product development, you often see accessibility validation happening near the end, during testing or finalizing stages. This approach assumes users with disabilities will merely tell you where you went wrong. However, this gives all the power to the designer.\n\nWhat’s more effective—and truly inclusive—is shifting to an early user-centric design. Get user feedback while you’re still designing, not after you've built something. It’s about asking the right questions upfront:\n\n- What don’t we know about how users will interact with this product?\n- What assumptions can we challenge that may exclude someone?\n- How can people with disabilities contribute to the design before it's even a prototype?\n\n## Embracing Diversity by Default\n\nOne of the most powerful philosophies in inclusive design is, \"Nothing About Us Without Us.\" It encapsulates a critical concept: don’t design for people with disabilities _without_ including their voices, perspectives, and experiences.\n\nAccessible design in Web3 must reflect the diverse community it serves. This means that inclusivity needs to become the default, baked into the process, and not an afterthought. In a decentralized Web3 future, diversity in design means creating products that can adapt to any user—no matter their abilities, technologies, or location.\n\n## Conclusion: A Call for Intentional Inclusive Design\n\nThe key takeaway from this experience? Web3 inclusive design should empower all users, making sure that failure doesn't stem from exclusion or oversight. Instead of using accessibility checklists as the final step, the process needs to involve people with disabilities from the outset. Their contributions directly shape better outputs, ensuring inclusivity for all.\n\nAs we continue shaping the future of the decentralized web, we must make space: space for diversity in thought, experience, and ability. Only then can we truly create digital products that work for _everyone_.\n\nIntentional inclusion isn’t just necessary for legal compliance—it’s fundamental to responsible innovation in Web3. The future is decentralized; let’s make sure it’s also accessible for all.","src/content/blog/inclusive-design-in-web3.md","4802c80585eee6d4",{html:131,metadata:132},"<h1 id=\"web3-inclusive-design-how-failure-can-shape-success\">Web3 Inclusive Design: How Failure Can Shape Success</h1>\n<h2 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2>\n<p></p><details><summary>Open Table of contents</summary><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#learning-from-failure-the-video-player-case-study\">Learning from Failure: The Video Player Case Study</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#winning-the-contract-and-initial-setup\">Winning the Contract and Initial Setup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-missing-controls-a-simple-assumption-gone-wrong\">The Missing Controls: A Simple Assumption Gone Wrong</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#low-vision-users-a-missed-design-opportunity\">Low Vision Users: A Missed Design Opportunity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#redesigning-based-on-user-feedback\">Redesigning Based on User Feedback</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#practicing-true-inclusive-design-in-web3\">Practicing True Inclusive Design in Web3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#moving-from-accessibility-by-luck-to-intentional-inclusion\">Moving from “Accessibility by Luck” to Intentional Inclusion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#shifting-left-including-users-earlier-in-the-process\">Shifting Left: Including Users Earlier in the Process</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#embracing-diversity-by-default\">Embracing Diversity by Default</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion-a-call-for-intentional-inclusive-design\">Conclusion: A Call for Intentional Inclusive Design</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p></details><p></p>\n<h2 id=\"learning-from-failure-the-video-player-case-study\">Learning from Failure: The Video Player Case Study</h2>\n<p>I was contracted to build a custom video player that would be an accessibility triumph.

With blockchain, platforms can be built where content is immutable and censorship-resistant. Imagine a world where no authority can wipe out an inconvenient truth—or that regrettable hot take you posted at 3 a.m. Yeah, it's permanent.\n\n2. **Ownership of Content**  \n   Social media currently siphons your creative soul for free.

Unless the blockchain itself turns into the narrative, but that's another rabbit hole.\n\n4. **Decentralized Moderation**  \n   Moderation decisions could be governed by the community using token-based voting or DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).

Decentralization could amplify this, as groups split into micro-bubbles where every member agrees the sky is green.\n\n2. **Fake News, Now Permanent**  \n   Blockchain's immutability is a double-edged sword. Post something misleading? It’s there _forever_. The blockchain isn’t picky—it’ll store Pulitzer-worthy investigative journalism right next to your conspiracy theory about lizard people running the Federal Reserve.\n\n3. **Accessibility and Barriers to Entry**  \n   Web3 tech can be _intimidating_. Grandma barely got into Facebook; are we expecting her to manage a crypto wallet for reading the news? Tech adoption can feel like a massive barrier to inclusivity.\n\n4. **Decentralized Chaos**  \n   No central authority sounds great—until disputes arise. Imagine a fight over which version of the truth to trust. On-chain governance systems are new, prone to exploits, and could leave us worse off than squabbling moderators.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\n\nDecentralization offers tantalizing promises for better transparency, fairness, and content ownership in news and social media. But let’s not decentralize our common sense. Without careful design and moderation, the tech could inadvertently turbocharge some of the problems it's trying to solve. Blockchain isn’t a magic wand; it’s more like a very complex Swiss Army knife. Used wisely, it’s a game-changer. Used recklessly, it’s a recipe for chaos.\n\nSo, let’s tread carefully as we step into this brave new decentralized world.

This shift is not just about integrating blockchain technologies but also about emphasizing user-focused design principles. Unlike traditional web design, Web3 requires a rethinking of how users interact with websites, prioritizing decentralized experiences that meet user needs.\n\n![Web3 Development Image](https://images.pexels.com/photos/577585/pexels-photo-577585.jpeg)\n\n## Understanding User Needs in Web3\n\nNavigating the world of Web3 brings unique challenges and opportunities. Users today expect more than just access to decentralized applications; they demand intuitive interfaces and seamless experiences. How do we address these expectations?\n\n### Identifying Target Audience\n\nCreating user personas and analyzing demographics is crucial. Although the technology is intricate, simplifying it to fit the user’s perspective can be challenging. Clearly defining your audience helps in tailoring experiences that resonate with them.\n\n### Gathering Feedback and Insights\n\nCollecting user feedback is an ongoing process. Techniques like surveys and usability testing offer insights into user preferences and frustrations. These methods ensure that the development process remains agile and user-centric, focusing on continual improvement. Platforms that embrace user participation often see better adoption and engagement rates.\n\n## Design Principles for User-Centric Web3 Websites\n\nDesign is not just what it looks like, but how it works. For Web3 applications, this adage is fundamental.\n\n### Intuitive Navigation\n\nAn easy-to-navigate interface is imperative. If users struggle to find what they need, they're unlikely to return. Simplifying navigation while ensuring access to core features can significantly enhance user satisfaction.\n\n![Close-up of Computer Keyboard](https://images.pexels.com/photos/248515/pexels-photo-248515.png?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940)\nPhoto by [Pixabay](https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay)\n\n### Visual Clarity and Aesthetics\n\nAesthetic appeal and visual clarity play a big role in user engagement. Thoughtful use of color, typography, and layout can create a more compelling experience for users. Incorporating these elements strategically aligns with Web3's forward-thinking ethos.\n\n### From \"Mobile First\" to \"All Screens First\" Design Philosophy\n\nThe evolution of web development and design has transitioned from a \"mobile first\" approach to an \"all screens first\" philosophy, reflecting the reality that there is no longer a standard mobile screen size. This shift necessitates a significant mental adjustment for developers, as they must now consider how elements will adapt to a diverse array of screen sizes rather than just optimizing for mobile devices. With the introduction of container queries in CSS—now supported across all major browsers—designers can create responsive layouts that adjust based on the size of their containers, rather than relying solely on fixed breakpoints. Additionally, CSS Grid has streamlined the process of accommodating various screen sizes, making it easier to design flexible layouts. However, this complexity poses challenges for utility libraries like Tailwind and Bootstrap, which excel at managing predefined viewport widths. As the number of unique viewports and screen resolutions grows—exceeding 50 variations—these libraries can become cumbersome to maintain, highlighting the need for a more adaptable approach to responsive design that embraces the fluidity of modern devices.\n\n## Implementing Blockchain Features Mindfully\n\nBlockchain adds a layer of complexity that can overwhelm users. Thus, it’s essential to integrate these features thoughtfully.\n\n### User Education and Onboarding\n\nEducating users on blockchain and Web3 functionalities is paramount. Offer clear onboarding processes and educational resources that demystify the complexities of blockchain. When users understand the technology, they are more likely to engage with it confidently.\n\n### Security and Trustworthiness\n\nIn Web3, trust comes through transparency. Implement robust security features and communicate them clearly to users. Building trust through secure practices is crucial to nurturing user relationships and encouraging continued engagement.\n\n## Testing and Iterating Based on User Experience\n\nEven the most well-thought-out designs need testing and refinement.\n\n### A/B Testing and Analytics\n\nData analytics offer a gateway to understanding user behavior and preferences. A/B testing enables developers to experiment with different design elements and functionalities. Analyzing these metrics can guide improvements and optimize the user journey.\n\n### Continuous Improvement Cycle\n\nDeveloping a feedback loop for continuous improvements is essential. User feedback is the compass guiding ongoing enhancements in user experience. Regularly updating and refining web applications helps maintain their relevance in a rapidly changing digital ecosystem.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the evolving landscape of Web3, the importance of user-centric design cannot be overstated. By prioritizing user needs, intuitive design, thoughtful implementation of blockchain features, and continuous iteration, developers can build Web3 websites that are not only functional but also delightful to use. Keep the user at the forefront, and success in the Web3 frontier is within reach.","src/content/blog/overcoming-development-pitfalls-in-web3.md","8fb27788eb016b68",{html:229,metadata:230},"<h1 id=\"elevating-user-experience-in-web3-overcoming-development-pitfalls\">Elevating User Experience in Web3: Overcoming Development Pitfalls</h1>\n<h2 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2>\n<p></p><details><summary>Open Table of contents</summary><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#understanding-user-needs-in-web3\">Understanding User Needs in Web3</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#identifying-target-audience\">Identifying Target Audience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#gathering-feedback-and-insights\">Gathering Feedback and Insights</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#design-principles-for-user-centric-web3-websites\">Design Principles for User-Centric Web3 Websites</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#intuitive-navigation\">Intuitive Navigation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#visual-clarity-and-aesthetics\">Visual Clarity and Aesthetics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#from-mobile-first-to-all-screens-first-design-philosophy\">From “Mobile First” to “All Screens First” Design Philosophy</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#implementing-blockchain-features-mindfully\">Implementing Blockchain Features Mindfully</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#user-education-and-onboarding\">User Education and Onboarding</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#security-and-trustworthiness\">Security and Trustworthiness</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#testing-and-iterating-based-on-user-experience\">Testing and Iterating Based on User Experience</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ab-testing-and-analytics\">A/B Testing and Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#continuous-improvement-cycle\">Continuous Improvement Cycle</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p></details><p></p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-user-needs-in-web3\">Understanding User Needs in Web3</h2>\n<p>Navigating the world of Web3 brings unique challenges and opportunities.

Gerry McGovern's talk at \"An Event Apart\" in Denver 2017 shines a much-needed spotlight on the best way to measure and improve the customer experience. McGovern presented a robust framework for tackling this issue, showcasing actionable strategies to streamline digital interaction. I was lucky enough to attend this event and left this talk with goosebumps. His honest, no bullshit speaking style takes on bloated web designs and delivers direct solutions for a more user-friendly experience that works in Web3's rapidly expanding landscape.\n\nIn this blog post, I’ll break down the essential parts of McGovern’s insightful talk and point out how measuring the customer experience—and taking consistent action—can benefit your UX strategy in Web3. Here’s something to watch if you want to hear McGovern speak directly:\n\n[**Click the photo or this text to watch the video. Fun with youtube API**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpMiMc1ErQ)\n[![Web3 User Experience](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cdpMiMc1ErQ/sddefault.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpMiMc1ErQ)\n[**Click the photo or this text to watch the video. Fun with youtube API**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpMiMc1ErQ)\n\nMcGovern is funny, engaging and can articulate the often stupid choices we as marketers, developers, designers and everyone else make daily.\n\n> I’ve never worked on a project where a company asked me to reduce content, build overly complex systems, or just keep adding features for the sake of development.\n> If you’ve been in a corporate environment, you know that **if anyone spots any white space on a website, someone will want to fill it.** It doesn’t matter what the solution is; that white space will be utilized!\n> You might find yourself in multiple meetings discussing how to address this white space. Sometimes, it even leads to collaboration across departments to find a solution. But here’s the thing: **white space doesn’t always need a solution.**\n> it’s about real-world experience and data-driven decisions that translate into a better user journey.\n\n### Using Videos to Kickstart Engagement\n\nMcGovern opened with humor and a video, instantly reminding us of the power of visual content. Videos are an effective tool to get people invested quickly. In his case, it wasn’t just to keep the audience awake—he used the video to highlight a core usability problem: how navigation works on websites and how users react to poor web design.\n\nVideos have long been known to engage and inform simultaneously, and digital designers working in Web3 should take note. Visual content is a quick way to show users important information and engage them at an emotional level. Use it wisely, though—an irrelevant video can distract or even irritate your users.\n\n### Popularity of Travel Content: Can We Trust Navigation Data?\n\nOne of McGovern’s key points is how website owners can misinterpret user interactions without proper understanding of user intent. He highlighted how, on travel websites, many users focus too much on navigation, clicking around menus without completing their task. But is this good or bad?\n\n> Web statistics alone, like “clicks,” fail to explain why users >are clicking. More clicks don’t necessarily mean better engagement. If people are lost in a maze of navigation and aren’t finding what they need, then your site is failing, even if the metrics say otherwise. In Web3 UX, where users expect to interact with decentralized apps (dApps) and token-based ecosystems, navigation must be seamless, otherwise, trust—and engagement—drops quickly.\n\n### Understanding the Why Behind User Actions\n\nMetrics like time spent on a web page or number of clicks are easy to track, but they lack context. McGovern stresses that web performance needs to be paired with understanding user intent. In Web3, this translates to tracking not just what users are doing but **why** users aren't completing their desired tasks efficiently.\n\nFor instance, McGovern gave the example of someone trying to find travel documents for Canada, and instead of following the \"ideal navigation path,\" they were stalled by confusing options. Without knowing why people are clicking around or stalling, you're left with incomplete information.\n\nThis problem is magnified in Web3 applications. Users here are generally tech-savvy but impatient. If they’re spending undue time navigating or figuring out how to interact with a dApp, they’ll find alternatives—or not bother at all.\n\n### Travel to Canada: A Lesson in User Confusion\n\nMcGovern masterfully broke down a specific task: finding out what documents an Irish citizen needs to visit Canada. The expected user journey, according to the Canadian government, should start with \"Immigration.\" However, most users clicked on \"Travel,\" assuming that’s where to find the information. This simple semantic difference resulted in wasted time and user frustration.\n\nA goal of Web3 platforms should be removing friction like this. When your platform has specific terminology or jargon (like “smart contracts” or “consensus mechanisms”), simplify it. Customers don’t want to spend precious minutes trying to interpret tech-speak. A smooth Web3 user experience should feature clear, direct terms that reflect how users think.\n\n### The ETA vs. Visa Problem: Clarity is Key\n\nIn McGovern’s example, users were further confused because the Canadian government referred to a travel authorization document as an eTA (Electronic Travel Authorization) instead of a visa. This kind of bureaucratic terminology caused extra stress for users who aren’t familiar with it. It’s a reminder that while internal teams may be familiar with certain terms, users operate on completely different assumptions.\n\nIn Web3, this is a huge issue. Many Web3 platforms use complex terminology that confuses new users: gas fees, staking, slashing—terms that are crucial but need to be explained in a simple, intuitive way. If you want your Web3 app to attract mainstream users, it’s crucial to use language they understand, or at the very least, provide a quick and direct definition or explanation on the page.\n\n### Useless Images and Fancy Content: Don’t Be Distracting\n\nOne of the best parts of McGovern’s talk is his hilarious takedown of useless web content. Using examples like unnecessary photos (planes, stock images of happy families), McGovern showed how many organizations waste the most valuable real estate on their web pages with irrelevant content.\n\nThis applies to Web3 as well. Many sites rely on flashy visuals, excessive branding, or dense, technical copy. But do they really help the user accomplish what they need? Probably not. Relevancy is king. Get rid of the excess and make sure the content serves a purpose. For Web3, every interaction needs to lead towards the user’s goal, whether that’s minting a token, checking the status of a smart contract, or making a transaction.\n\n### Solving Problems Through Collaboration\n\nMcGovern shared an example of how the Canadian government solved their navigation issues. Through collaboration between different departments—immigration and foreign affairs—they improved their web experience by bringing fragmented sections into a cohesive unit. By placing a crucial \"Visit Canada\" link where users would reasonably expect it (on the Travel page), the two departments came together to serve the user—rather than their own separate silos.\n\nThis problem isn’t unique to the government. In decentralized Web3 projects, often multiple teams are working on different parts of the user experience. Smart contract developers may not have daily discussions with frontend engineers or UX designers. When everyone works independently, the result is a fragmented user experience.\n\n### Measuring Customer Experience in Web3: Success Rate and Time Matter\n\nMcGovern makes an excellent point: to optimize your website—especially in Web3 where actions are often highly specific and task-driven—you need to track two key metrics: **success rate** (percentage of users completing a task) and **time on task** (how long it takes them to do it).\n\nThink about a wallet dApp. If a customer can’t figure out how to transfer tokens within a reasonable time, your product has failed, even if engagement metrics look fine on paper. Success rate and speed are the truest measures of UX efficiency.\n\n### Case Study: Simplicity Beats Innovation in Canadian Passport Service\n\nMcGovern shared a case from Canada’s passport service. In an attempt to be innovative, they introduced an interactive map with thousands of locations. The result? Users couldn’t figure out where to go and success rates plummeted. The simple fix? A basic box where users could input their postal code and get the nearest passport center. Success rates shot up to 100%.\n\nThe lesson for Web3? Don’t overcomplicate things. Cool innovations are great, but they should never take priority over a smooth user experience. Token transfers, staking, and smart contract interactions should be as straightforward as possible.\n\n### Focusing on Core Tasks\n\nIn his talk, McGovern emphasized a crucial point: keep it simple. Focus on core tasks. In Web3, this means getting users from point A to point B as quickly as possible. Whether it’s secure transfers, staking tokens, or voting in decentralized governance, the user’s key tasks should always be the focus.\n\nFor instance, in a staking dApp, what do users want? Primarily, they want to know how to stake their tokens quickly, see the expected returns, and easily track rewards. Anything beyond that—features that aren’t directly related to that core function—is only extra noise. Offer it in simplified forms later, but when the user first arrives, make that core task a stress-free experience.\n\n### The Power of Links and Task-Based Design\n\nPerhaps the most revolutionary idea McGovern shared is the importance of correct links. Clear, direct links that take people exactly to the information they need are underrated—and as McGovern painfully pointed out, sorely underused. Links aren’t just clickables on a page—they’re the backbone of user journeys.\n\nFor Web3 projects especially, where information can be fragmented, the right links can make or break a user’s ability to navigate the platform. Whether it’s a user trying to read a smart contract's details or check the network status, links should always lead users directly where they expect to go.\n\n### Remote User Testing: Fast, Affordable, and Effective\n\nPerhaps the most actionable takeaway for Web3 developers was McGovern’s advocacy for remote user testing. Unlike lab-based testing, remote testing allows users to test the site in their natural environment—on their computer or mobile—where they are more likely to behave normally.\n\nWhen constructing decentralized platforms and dApps, remote testing should be a key part of development. It’s crucial to see how users interact with your dApp in real-time and their own environments.

Gerry McGovern’s talk at “An Event Apart” in Denver 2017 shines a much-needed spotlight on the best way to measure and improve the customer experience. McGovern presented a robust framework for tackling this issue, showcasing actionable strategies to streamline digital interaction. I was lucky enough to attend this event and left this talk with goosebumps. His honest, no bullshit speaking style takes on bloated web designs and delivers direct solutions for a more user-friendly experience that works in Web3’s rapidly expanding landscape.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I’ll break down the essential parts of McGovern’s insightful talk and point out how measuring the customer experience—and taking consistent action—can benefit your UX strategy in Web3. Here’s something to watch if you want to hear McGovern speak directly:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpMiMc1ErQ\"><strong>Click the photo or this text to watch the video. Fun with youtube API</strong></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpMiMc1ErQ\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cdpMiMc1ErQ/sddefault.webp\" alt=\"Web3 User Experience\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpMiMc1ErQ\"><strong>Click the photo or this text to watch the video. Fun with youtube API</strong></a></p>\n<p>McGovern is funny, engaging and can articulate the often stupid choices we as marketers, developers, designers and everyone else make daily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve never worked on a project where a company asked me to reduce content, build overly complex systems, or just keep adding features for the sake of development.\nIf you’ve been in a corporate environment, you know that <strong>if anyone spots any white space on a website, someone will want to fill it.</strong> It doesn’t matter what the solution is; that white space will be utilized!\nYou might find yourself in multiple meetings discussing how to address this white space. Sometimes, it even leads to collaboration across departments to find a solution. But here’s the thing: <strong>white space doesn’t always need a solution.</strong>\nit’s about real-world experience and data-driven decisions that translate into a better user journey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"using-videos-to-kickstart-engagement\">Using Videos to Kickstart Engagement</h3>\n<p>McGovern opened with humor and a video, instantly reminding us of the power of visual content. Videos are an effective tool to get people invested quickly. In his case, it wasn’t just to keep the audience awake—he used the video to highlight a core usability problem: how navigation works on websites and how users react to poor web design.</p>\n<p>Videos have long been known to engage and inform simultaneously, and digital designers working in Web3 should take note. Visual content is a quick way to show users important information and engage them at an emotional level. Use it wisely, though—an irrelevant video can distract or even irritate your users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"popularity-of-travel-content-can-we-trust-navigation-data\">Popularity of Travel Content: Can We Trust Navigation Data?</h3>\n<p>One of McGovern’s key points is how website owners can misinterpret user interactions without proper understanding of user intent. He highlighted how, on travel websites, many users focus too much on navigation, clicking around menus without completing their task. But is this good or bad?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Web statistics alone, like “clicks,” fail to explain why users >are clicking. More clicks don’t necessarily mean better engagement. If people are lost in a maze of navigation and aren’t finding what they need, then your site is failing, even if the metrics say otherwise. In Web3 UX, where users expect to interact with decentralized apps (dApps) and token-based ecosystems, navigation must be seamless, otherwise, trust—and engagement—drops quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-the-why-behind-user-actions\">Understanding the Why Behind User Actions</h3>\n<p>Metrics like time spent on a web page or number of clicks are easy to track, but they lack context. McGovern stresses that web performance needs to be paired with understanding user intent. In Web3, this translates to tracking not just what users are doing but <strong>why</strong> users aren’t completing their desired tasks efficiently.</p>\n<p>For instance, McGovern gave the example of someone trying to find travel documents for Canada, and instead of following the “ideal navigation path,” they were stalled by confusing options. Without knowing why people are clicking around or stalling, you’re left with incomplete information.</p>\n<p>This problem is magnified in Web3 applications. Users here are generally tech-savvy but impatient. If they’re spending undue time navigating or figuring out how to interact with a dApp, they’ll find alternatives—or not bother at all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"travel-to-canada-a-lesson-in-user-confusion\">Travel to Canada: A Lesson in User Confusion</h3>\n<p>McGovern masterfully broke down a specific task: finding out what documents an Irish citizen needs to visit Canada. The expected user journey, according to the Canadian government, should start with “Immigration.” However, most users clicked on “Travel,” assuming that’s where to find the information. This simple semantic difference resulted in wasted time and user frustration.</p>\n<p>A goal of Web3 platforms should be removing friction like this. When your platform has specific terminology or jargon (like “smart contracts” or “consensus mechanisms”), simplify it. Customers don’t want to spend precious minutes trying to interpret tech-speak. A smooth Web3 user experience should feature clear, direct terms that reflect how users think.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-eta-vs-visa-problem-clarity-is-key\">The ETA vs. Visa Problem: Clarity is Key</h3>\n<p>In McGovern’s example, users were further confused because the Canadian government referred to a travel authorization document as an eTA (Electronic Travel Authorization) instead of a visa. This kind of bureaucratic terminology caused extra stress for users who aren’t familiar with it. It’s a reminder that while internal teams may be familiar with certain terms, users operate on completely different assumptions.</p>\n<p>In Web3, this is a huge issue. Many Web3 platforms use complex terminology that confuses new users: gas fees, staking, slashing—terms that are crucial but need to be explained in a simple, intuitive way. If you want your Web3 app to attract mainstream users, it’s crucial to use language they understand, or at the very least, provide a quick and direct definition or explanation on the page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"useless-images-and-fancy-content-dont-be-distracting\">Useless Images and Fancy Content: Don’t Be Distracting</h3>\n<p>One of the best parts of McGovern’s talk is his hilarious takedown of useless web content. Using examples like unnecessary photos (planes, stock images of happy families), McGovern showed how many organizations waste the most valuable real estate on their web pages with irrelevant content.</p>\n<p>This applies to Web3 as well. Many sites rely on flashy visuals, excessive branding, or dense, technical copy. But do they really help the user accomplish what they need? Probably not. Relevancy is king. Get rid of the excess and make sure the content serves a purpose. For Web3, every interaction needs to lead towards the user’s goal, whether that’s minting a token, checking the status of a smart contract, or making a transaction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solving-problems-through-collaboration\">Solving Problems Through Collaboration</h3>\n<p>McGovern shared an example of how the Canadian government solved their navigation issues. Through collaboration between different departments—immigration and foreign affairs—they improved their web experience by bringing fragmented sections into a cohesive unit. By placing a crucial “Visit Canada” link where users would reasonably expect it (on the Travel page), the two departments came together to serve the user—rather than their own separate silos.</p>\n<p>This problem isn’t unique to the government. In decentralized Web3 projects, often multiple teams are working on different parts of the user experience. Smart contract developers may not have daily discussions with frontend engineers or UX designers. When everyone works independently, the result is a fragmented user experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"measuring-customer-experience-in-web3-success-rate-and-time-matter\">Measuring Customer Experience in Web3: Success Rate and Time Matter</h3>\n<p>McGovern makes an excellent point: to optimize your website—especially in Web3 where actions are often highly specific and task-driven—you need to track two key metrics: <strong>success rate</strong> (percentage of users completing a task) and <strong>time on task</strong> (how long it takes them to do it).</p>\n<p>Think about a wallet dApp. If a customer can’t figure out how to transfer tokens within a reasonable time, your product has failed, even if engagement metrics look fine on paper. Success rate and speed are the truest measures of UX efficiency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"case-study-simplicity-beats-innovation-in-canadian-passport-service\">Case Study: Simplicity Beats Innovation in Canadian Passport Service</h3>\n<p>McGovern shared a case from Canada’s passport service. In an attempt to be innovative, they introduced an interactive map with thousands of locations. The result? Users couldn’t figure out where to go and success rates plummeted. The simple fix? A basic box where users could input their postal code and get the nearest passport center. Success rates shot up to 100%.</p>\n<p>The lesson for Web3? Don’t overcomplicate things. Cool innovations are great, but they should never take priority over a smooth user experience. Token transfers, staking, and smart contract interactions should be as straightforward as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"focusing-on-core-tasks\">Focusing on Core Tasks</h3>\n<p>In his talk, McGovern emphasized a crucial point: keep it simple. Focus on core tasks. In Web3, this means getting users from point A to point B as quickly as possible. Whether it’s secure transfers, staking tokens, or voting in decentralized governance, the user’s key tasks should always be the focus.</p>\n<p>For instance, in a staking dApp, what do users want? Primarily, they want to know how to stake their tokens quickly, see the expected returns, and easily track rewards. Anything beyond that—features that aren’t directly related to that core function—is only extra noise. Offer it in simplified forms later, but when the user first arrives, make that core task a stress-free experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-power-of-links-and-task-based-design\">The Power of Links and Task-Based Design</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most revolutionary idea McGovern shared is the importance of correct links. Clear, direct links that take people exactly to the information they need are underrated—and as McGovern painfully pointed out, sorely underused. Links aren’t just clickables on a page—they’re the backbone of user journeys.</p>\n<p>For Web3 projects especially, where information can be fragmented, the right links can make or break a user’s ability to navigate the platform. Whether it’s a user trying to read a smart contract’s details or check the network status, links should always lead users directly where they expect to go.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remote-user-testing-fast-affordable-and-effective\">Remote User Testing: Fast, Affordable, and Effective</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most actionable takeaway for Web3 developers was McGovern’s advocacy for remote user testing. Unlike lab-based testing, remote testing allows users to test the site in their natural environment—on their computer or mobile—where they are more likely to behave normally.</p>\n<p>When constructing decentralized platforms and dApps, remote testing should be a key part of development. It’s crucial to see how users interact with your dApp in real-time and their own environments. Because Web3 technology can sometimes feel intimidating or confusing, understanding real-world behavior is essential.</p>\n<h3 id=\"simple-solutions-win-customer-loyalty\">Simple Solutions Win Customer Loyalty</h3>\n<p>Focusing on saving your customers time, simplifying their path, and ensuring their success will pay off in any Web3 experience.

As momentum for Web3 builds, a focus on user ownership and decentralization, along with a premium on privacy, threatens to upend traditional SEO practices while opening up fresh avenues for companies to better position themselves online.\n\nIn this article, we show some of the major ways Web3 is going to impact search engine optimization and also provide actionable insights for businesses looking to adapt.\n\n---\n\n## What is Web3, and How Does It Differ from Web2?\n\nBefore diving into its impact on SEO, let's understand what Web3 represents.\n\n**Web2:** This is the current era of the Internet, nicely characterized by Google, Facebook, and Amazon—all centralized platforms, in a manner of speaking—that dominate information retrieval, social interaction, and e-commerce. These platforms make money by selling users' data and act as the gatekeepers to online visibility.\n\n**Web3:** Web3 is all about shifting power from centralized entities back to the user with the use of blockchain technology. For this reason, in Web3, users own their data, interact with dApps, and function in an environment where privacy and peer-to-peer links are prioritized.\n\nKey attributes of Web3 include:\n\n- Decentralized hosting of content.\n- Blockchain-based domains, like .crypto and .eth.\n- Cryptocurrency and tokenized interactions.\n- Enhanced privacy, user control over data.\n\nThese basic shifts challenge the centralized search paradigms that SEO was built on in Web2.\n\n---\n\n### Key Ways Web3 Is Going to Affect SEO\n\n#### 1. Decentralized Search Engines\n\nWeb3 gives a whole new meaning to decentralized search engines, which would run on blockchain networks. Unlike Google, the engines do not rely on any centralized servers or algorithms but leverage peer-to-peer networks, which incentivize users to take part in indexing and curation.\n\n**SEO Implications:**\n\n- **Reduced Dominance of Google:** Optimization would be required for Presearch and BitClout or other newly emerging blockchain-based search engines.\n- **Community Governed Rankings:** Rankings will rely more on community voting or blockchain governance than on proprietary algorithms.\n- **Optimization Strategy Change:** Traditional SEO factors of backlinks and keyword density may not be applicable anymore but rather give way to authenticity of content and blockchain verifiability.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Blockchain Domains and Decentralized Websites\n\nWeb3 offers a set of blockchain domains including .crypto, .eth, and .dao, among many others, hosted on decentralized networks, offering much better privacy and ownership.\n\n**SEO Implications:**\n\n- **Challenges in Crawling and Indexing:** Decentralized websites may not be accessible to traditional search engines, and thus, SEO professionals have to change their indexing strategies.\n- **Domain Authority Reimagined:** Blockchain domains work outside of traditional DNS systems and can upset traditional metrics for domain authority.\n- **Content Permanence:** On decentralized systems like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), the content is immutable; hence, updating or even SEO changes must be carefully planned.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Privacy-Centric User Behavior\n\nThe focus of Web3 is on making sure user data is private, and the control lies with the user. That is quite opposite to Web2, which is based on tracking cookies and user data for targeted advertising and SEO insights.\n\n**SEO Implications:**\n\n- **Decline of Third-Party Data:** Without cookies or centralized user data, businesses will have to use zero-party data; that is, data shared willingly by users.\n- **Keywords and Behavioral Analytics May Change:** With tracking capabilities such as Google Analytics diminished, businesses may need to devise newer, innovative ways to understand user intent.\n- **Content Transparency:** Users in Web3 will likely favor transparent content over manipulative SEO tactics.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Engaged and Rewarded Tokenization\n\nWeb3 allows the creation of token-based ecosystems where users are incentivized with cryptocurrency or tokens for creating content, curating information, or other value additions to communities.\n\n**SEO Implications:**\n\n- **New Engagement Metrics:** Performance may be measured through tokenized interactions (e.g., upvotes or tips), not traditional measures like clicks and bounce rates.\n- **Content Sharing Incentivization:** Businesses can develop token-based incentives for users to share and interact with content, further increasing visibility.\n- **Move to CTR Optimization:** Businesses could instead optimize for engagement within tokenized networks.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Growing Focus on Authenticity\n\nWeb3's transparent and immutable blockchain environment makes it more difficult for bad actors to manipulate search rankings or publish false information.\n\n**SEO Implications:**\n\n- **Reputation Verification:** Blockchain verifiability can be a ranking factor in which content creators are rewarded for having transparent, credible histories.\n- **Less Manipulation:** Current spammy strategies, such as black-hat SEO, link farms, and keyword stuffing, may lose much relevance in this system, where authenticity will play a central role.\n- **More Quality, Less Quantity:** Instead of just volume, content quality and user trust will likely determine visibility.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Voice and AI Search in Web3\n\nWeb3 technologies integrate AI-driven systems and voice search assistants at the backend of decentralized networks.\n\n**SEO Implications:**\n\n- **Optimization for Decentralized AI:** Businesses will need to ensure that their content is discoverable by decentralized AI tools.\n- **Conversational SEO Expands:** The rise of voice will require optimization for more natural, conversational searches.\n- **Integration with Blockchain-Based AI Models:** Content strategy may need to align with decentralized AI training data.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. Monetization of Content in Decentralized Ways\n\nWeb3 empowers creators to monetize directly without intermediaries. Creatives can tokenize their work using platforms like NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\n\n**SEO Implications:**\n\n- **SEO for NFTs:** Metadata and description optimization will be required for NFTs by companies to enhance discoverability in decentralized marketplaces.\n- **Monetization-Driven Visibility:** Content can gain visibility based on its revenue generation in tokenized ecosystems.\n- **Shift to Creator Economies:** SEO strategies will need to support this new economy of individual creators and tokenized business models.\n\n---\n\n### Actionable SEO Strategies for Web3\n\n1. **Adopt Decentralized Search Engines:** Optimize your content for new blockchain search platforms, including Presearch.\n2. **Claim Blockchain Domains:** Get your brand on the decentralized web by registering blockchain domains such as .crypto or .eth.  \n   _Unstoppable Domains is a great place to start._\n3. **Leverage Zero-Party Data:** Focus on building trust with users to collect first-party and zero-party data ethically.  \n   _Learn about zero-party data: HubSpot Zero-Party Data Guide._\n4. **Tokenized Incentives:** Use tokens to reward users for their time and interactions with your content.\n5. **Emphasize Authenticity of Content:** Showcase transparent sourcing and credibility in your content. Blockchain records can be used to prove this.\n6. **Optimize for Voice and AI Search:** Prepare your content for decentralized AI and voice search by using conversational language and structured data.  \n   _Structured Data Guide._\n7. **Track Decentralized Metrics:** Engage with blockchain analytics to track engagement and visibility.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion: Embracing SEO in a Decentralized World\n\nWeb3 is setting a new meaning for the internet, and SEO will need to change along with it. While traditional approaches will continue to bear value, businesses must be future-ready for decentralized search engines, privacy-centric user behavior, and tokenized engagement models.\n\nThe shift to Web3 creates an opportunity to craft more authentic, user-focused content while embracing the values of decentralization and transparency. By adapting now, businesses can position themselves to thrive in the next generation of the internet.\n\n---\n\n### Sources:\n\n1. **Presearch - Decentralized Search Engine**: [https://presearch.io](https://presearch.io)\n2. **Unstoppable Domains - Blockchain Domains**: [https://unstoppabledomains.com](https://unstoppabledomains.com)\n3. **HubSpot Zero-Party Data Guide**: [https://blog.hubspot.com](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/zero-party-data)\n4. **IPFS - InterPlanetary File System**: [https://ipfs.tech](https://ipfs.tech)\n5. **Blockchain and SEO Insights**: [https://moz.com](https://moz.com)\n6. **NFT SEO Strategies**: [https://opensea.io](https://opensea.io)\n7. **Voice Search Optimization Guide**: [https://searchengineland.com](https://searchengineland.com)\n8. **Blockchain Analytics Tools**: [https://www.blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com)","src/content/blog/web3-seo-guide.md","b1fc364c1a45817d",{html:491,metadata:492},"<h3 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h3>\n<p></p><details><summary>Open Table of contents</summary><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#how-web3-will-change-seo-a-whole-new-frontier-for-digital-marketing\">How Web3 Will Change SEO: A Whole New Frontier for Digital Marketing</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-web3-and-how-does-it-differ-from-web2\">What is Web3, and How Does It Differ from Web2?</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#key-ways-web3-is-going-to-affect-seo\">Key Ways Web3 Is Going to Affect SEO</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#1-decentralized-search-engines\">1.

For this reason, in Web3, users own their data, interact with dApps, and function in an environment where privacy and peer-to-peer links are prioritized.</p>\n<p>Key attributes of Web3 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decentralized hosting of content.</li>\n<li>Blockchain-based domains, like .crypto and .eth.</li>\n<li>Cryptocurrency and tokenized interactions.</li>\n<li>Enhanced privacy, user control over data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These basic shifts challenge the centralized search paradigms that SEO was built on in Web2.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"key-ways-web3-is-going-to-affect-seo\">Key Ways Web3 Is Going to Affect SEO</h3>\n<h4 id=\"1-decentralized-search-engines\">1. Decentralized Search Engines</h4>\n<p>Web3 gives a whole new meaning to decentralized search engines, which would run on blockchain networks. Unlike Google, the engines do not rely on any centralized servers or algorithms but leverage peer-to-peer networks, which incentivize users to take part in indexing and curation.</p>\n<p><strong>SEO Implications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Dominance of Google:</strong> Optimization would be required for Presearch and BitClout or other newly emerging blockchain-based search engines.</li>\n<li><strong>Community Governed Rankings:</strong> Rankings will rely more on community voting or blockchain governance than on proprietary algorithms.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimization Strategy Change:</strong> Traditional SEO factors of backlinks and keyword density may not be applicable anymore but rather give way to authenticity of content and blockchain verifiability.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"2-blockchain-domains-and-decentralized-websites\">2. Blockchain Domains and Decentralized Websites</h4>\n<p>Web3 offers a set of blockchain domains including .crypto, .eth, and .dao, among many others, hosted on decentralized networks, offering much better privacy and ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>SEO Implications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Challenges in Crawling and Indexing:</strong> Decentralized websites may not be accessible to traditional search engines, and thus, SEO professionals have to change their indexing strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Domain Authority Reimagined:</strong> Blockchain domains work outside of traditional DNS systems and can upset traditional metrics for domain authority.</li>\n<li><strong>Content Permanence:</strong> On decentralized systems like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), the content is immutable; hence, updating or even SEO changes must be carefully planned.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"3-privacy-centric-user-behavior\">3. Privacy-Centric User Behavior</h4>\n<p>The focus of Web3 is on making sure user data is private, and the control lies with the user. That is quite opposite to Web2, which is based on tracking cookies and user data for targeted advertising and SEO insights.</p>\n<p><strong>SEO Implications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decline of Third-Party Data:</strong> Without cookies or centralized user data, businesses will have to use zero-party data; that is, data shared willingly by users.</li>\n<li><strong>Keywords and Behavioral Analytics May Change:</strong> With tracking capabilities such as Google Analytics diminished, businesses may need to devise newer, innovative ways to understand user intent.</li>\n<li><strong>Content Transparency:</strong> Users in Web3 will likely favor transparent content over manipulative SEO tactics.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"4-engaged-and-rewarded-tokenization\">4. Engaged and Rewarded Tokenization</h4>\n<p>Web3 allows the creation of token-based ecosystems where users are incentivized with cryptocurrency or tokens for creating content, curating information, or other value additions to communities.</p>\n<p><strong>SEO Implications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Engagement Metrics:</strong> Performance may be measured through tokenized interactions (e.g., upvotes or tips), not traditional measures like clicks and bounce rates.</li>\n<li><strong>Content Sharing Incentivization:</strong> Businesses can develop token-based incentives for users to share and interact with content, further increasing visibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Move to CTR Optimization:</strong> Businesses could instead optimize for engagement within tokenized networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"5-growing-focus-on-authenticity\">5. Growing Focus on Authenticity</h4>\n<p>Web3’s transparent and immutable blockchain environment makes it more difficult for bad actors to manipulate search rankings or publish false information.</p>\n<p><strong>SEO Implications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reputation Verification:</strong> Blockchain verifiability can be a ranking factor in which content creators are rewarded for having transparent, credible histories.</li>\n<li><strong>Less Manipulation:</strong> Current spammy strategies, such as black-hat SEO, link farms, and keyword stuffing, may lose much relevance in this system, where authenticity will play a central role.</li>\n<li><strong>More Quality, Less Quantity:</strong> Instead of just volume, content quality and user trust will likely determine visibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"6-voice-and-ai-search-in-web3\">6. Voice and AI Search in Web3</h4>\n<p>Web3 technologies integrate AI-driven systems and voice search assistants at the backend of decentralized networks.</p>\n<p><strong>SEO Implications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimization for Decentralized AI:</strong> Businesses will need to ensure that their content is discoverable by decentralized AI tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Conversational SEO Expands:</strong> The rise of voice will require optimization for more natural, conversational searches.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration with Blockchain-Based AI Models:</strong> Content strategy may need to align with decentralized AI training data.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"7-monetization-of-content-in-decentralized-ways\">7. Monetization of Content in Decentralized Ways</h4>\n<p>Web3 empowers creators to monetize directly without intermediaries. Creatives can tokenize their work using platforms like NFTs (non-fungible tokens).</p>\n<p><strong>SEO Implications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SEO for NFTs:</strong> Metadata and description optimization will be required for NFTs by companies to enhance discoverability in decentralized marketplaces.</li>\n<li><strong>Monetization-Driven Visibility:</strong> Content can gain visibility based on its revenue generation in tokenized ecosystems.</li>\n<li><strong>Shift to Creator Economies:</strong> SEO strategies will need to support this new economy of individual creators and tokenized business models.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"actionable-seo-strategies-for-web3\">Actionable SEO Strategies for Web3</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Adopt Decentralized Search Engines:</strong> Optimize your content for new blockchain search platforms, including Presearch.</li>\n<li><strong>Claim Blockchain Domains:</strong> Get your brand on the decentralized web by registering blockchain domains such as .crypto or .eth.<br>\n<em>Unstoppable Domains is a great place to start.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Leverage Zero-Party Data:</strong> Focus on building trust with users to collect first-party and zero-party data ethically.<br>\n<em>Learn about zero-party data: HubSpot Zero-Party Data Guide.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Tokenized Incentives:</strong> Use tokens to reward users for their time and interactions with your content.</li>\n<li><strong>Emphasize Authenticity of Content:</strong> Showcase transparent sourcing and credibility in your content. Blockchain records can be used to prove this.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize for Voice and AI Search:</strong> Prepare your content for decentralized AI and voice search by using conversational language and structured data.<br>\n<em>Structured Data Guide.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Track Decentralized Metrics:</strong> Engage with blockchain analytics to track engagement and visibility.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-embracing-seo-in-a-decentralized-world\">Conclusion: Embracing SEO in a Decentralized World</h3>\n<p>Web3 is setting a new meaning for the internet, and SEO will need to change along with it. While traditional approaches will continue to bear value, businesses must be future-ready for decentralized search engines, privacy-centric user behavior, and tokenized engagement models.</p>\n<p>The shift to Web3 creates an opportunity to craft more authentic, user-focused content while embracing the values of decentralization and transparency. By adapting now, businesses can position themselves to thrive in the next generation of the internet.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"sources\">Sources:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Presearch - Decentralized Search Engine</strong>: <a href=\"https://presearch.io\">https://presearch.io</a></li>\n<li><strong>Unstoppable Domains - Blockchain Domains</strong>: <a href=\"https://unstoppabledomains.com\">https://unstoppabledomains.com</a></li>\n<li><strong>HubSpot Zero-Party Data Guide</strong>: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/zero-party-data\">https://blog.hubspot.com</a></li>\n<li><strong>IPFS - InterPlanetary File System</strong>: <a href=\"https://ipfs.tech\">https://ipfs.tech</a></li>\n<li><strong>Blockchain and SEO Insights</strong>: <a href=\"https://moz.com\">https://moz.com</a></li>\n<li><strong>NFT SEO Strategies</strong>: <a href=\"https://opensea.io\">https://opensea.io</a></li>\n<li><strong>Voice Search Optimization Guide</strong>: <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com\">https://searchengineland.com</a></li>\n<li><strong>Blockchain Analytics Tools</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com\">https://www.blockchain.com</a></li>\n</ol>",{headings:493,imagePaths:534,frontmatter:535},[494,495,498,501,504,507,510,513,516,519,522,525,528,531],{depth:41,slug:42,text:43},{depth:135,slug:496,text:497},"how-web3-will-change-seo-a-whole-new-frontier-for-digital-marketing","How Web3 Will Change SEO: A Whole New Frontier for Digital Marketing",{depth:45,slug:499,text:500},"what-is-web3-and-how-does-it-differ-from-web2","What is Web3, and How Does It Differ from Web2?",{depth:41,slug:502,text:503},"key-ways-web3-is-going-to-affect-seo","Key Ways Web3 Is Going to Affect SEO",{depth:391,slug:505,text:506},"1-decentralized-search-engines","1.

The industry remains a mess, from centralized exchanges (CEX) to decentralized exchanges (DEX), to all the cool things we can build.\n\nI often wonder why I was accepted for the Forbes Legacy Pass. I had zero expectation of being accepted so I just wrote exactly how I felt about Web3 and the **critical** need for a decentralized web.\n\n### Whats at stake?\n\nWe are currently being held hostage by big tech. The fact that we have allowed three or four large companies control everything we do down to the use of AI. This is where things start to get messy.\n\nLets use Google as an example. Google is integrating their AI model Gemeni into all of their products. While this might be helpful at first, it will quickly change how we use the web within the next two years. Google is returing very accuracte AI results when we search, it won't be long until having a website is pointless. Why browse to a website when AI can simply return information from your website and provide it a user.\n\nThere will be less and less users browsing websites as the need to do so becomes obsolute. We are truly stairing down the barrel of a gun.\n\nThis will change how we shop, browse, and interact with the web as we currently know it.\n\n### The Only Solution\n\n**Decentrlization** is essential if we want to have a say in any of this. Web3 is a decentrilized web that can take on the threat from big tech and AI. Quality content, products, and services will be reconigized not by algorithms (although I do forsee a decentilized \"Google\" coming in the not so distant future) but by me and you. Web3 is the promise of returning the web to users not big tech. If we fail to move to a decentrilized web, we risk losing our indepence and ability to innovate. There is simply to much at stake for us to emprace decentilization.\n\n### If this is true, why hasn't Web3 seen mass adoption?\n\nWell this is where things get frustrating as all hell. As opposed to building a decentrilized web that appeals to everyone, we have made the barrier to entry far to complex. The technology behind Web3 is facinating and very lucrative.\n\nI enjoy making money as much as the next person but this should be why we use Web3. Let's break down some common issues:\n\n- **Venture Capital** by and large VCs have plagued Crypto markets as soon they realized it was a cash cow. These snakes in suits are backing projects that have some value and using this playbook:\n  - Identiy a project to back that is worth: $100,00.000\n    - Dump and an excessive amount of money into the project. The $100,000.00 project is now worth $1,000,000.00.\n    - Generate buzz and go through another round of inventments.\n      - After this round, more VCs have poured money into the project which is now valued at $10,000,000.00.\n      - Now that the project has some big investors behind it, it will attract another round of investments.\n        - The second round of investments is usually where things really get crazy. The project is now valued at $50,000,00.00. Note the underlying project hasn't fundementaly changed. Money is on marketing, and hiring cheap digital labor. Everyone from Marketing to Development has a tenues grasp on the technology they are working with. This is perfectly fine as the project doesn't have to be great anymore, it just needs to make money.\n        - There will likely be one more round because greed is inherit to these suits. Now the project is worth close to $75,000,000.00 despite the fact the project hasn't changed and is still worth the initial $100,000.00.\n    - **Time to Cash in** - Now that the value of a project has been inflated preventing retail investors from ever getting their foot in the door, the slow release of tokens can begin. The VC's own the majority of them and since the project is valued at $75,000,000.00 and has recieved industry buzz. People are pouring money into projects they don't understand aside from the hope of making money. Unforturnetly this will never happen as coins/tokens are being purchased at prices far above what the value of the project is.\n      - Now the VC's can sit back and watch as the price of the tokens/coins they control baloon.\n\nIn summary this con has devistated Crypto markets and is destryoying Web3. Projects are being realeased before they are actually finised as the race to pay back the VC's is now the sole priority for the project. What we are left with is a Web3 that priotizes ROI over users. The fatal flaw that has kept Web3 from ever having a chance at taking off.\n\nThis is unfortuantly just one of the large issues plaguing Web3.\n\n### What else is wrong with Web3?\n\nWe have this idea that using the same tools and techniques that drive Web2 will work for Web3. This is a fatal flaw akin to putting sqaure wheels on your car. It just doesn't work and what makes this issue even worse is the quality of the projects following this paradigmn. Web3 is littered with poorly developed websites and dapps. Built by the cheapest labor a company can hire in order to rush projects out the door before the competition.\n\n**What happends when a project is rushed?**\n\n- Branding is not thought through.\n- Go to market is a race not well thought out process.\n- Development is lackluster, leaving users frustred with broken projects and a user experience that was never planned or even discussed.\n- Complex technical jargon is fun to those of us who understand it. This represents a small segement of users, the vast majoiry of potential users have no idea what all the technical jargon means. It's very difficult for projects to take off when the vast majority of users have no idea how to use a product.\n- Development for the sake of development. This really gets my blood pumping as this practice is moving us back to Web1. Is it cool we can build amazing things? Yes of course but is actually necessary for the project? My bet is its not. Only develop what is necessary for the project to work, introduce features when necessary not because you can.\n\nThe list goes on but for the most part these are some of the biggest issues plaguing Web3 and preventing mass adoption.\n\n### So what do we do?\n\nWell this should be a no brainer. Slow down and make sure your project is built for the user and not the product or service. Web3 is for users, negletcing them in favor of building cool stuff your product is detremintal. Our goal is create a web that reduces friction between the user and project they are interacting with. Even the most advanced game changing project will fail if its to complex and difficult for a user.\n\n### Do you have an example of a good project?\n\ni'm so glad you asked. Lets take a look at some **amazing** projects that are doing things correctly. We're going to break down what they are doing to help you create a project that moves Web3 forward not backwards.\n\n---\n\n## Issues:\n\n- Web3 Perception\n\nI recently completed my Marketing Mini-MBA, where Web3 was consistently mocked—not just by students, but also by industry leaders. It's embarrassing to have Web3 ridiculed by classmates and instructors alike.\n\n**Are they right to laugh?**\n\n**Yes!** Web3 is genuinely problematic, and I believe others must recognize this. While I appreciate the rapid pace of innovation and the influx of new projects, there are significant issues. With over 40 wallets and no **easy** central access point for Web3 content, users have become second-class citizens—a frightening development.\n\n### Remember \"Users\"?? Those people who use your project.\n\nUsers were once paramount; when treated well, they returned to your website. Web3 has taken the opposite approach: build as quickly as possible, using unnecessary tools, disregarding performance, and forgetting that not all users have 60-inch 4K screens with fiber internet.\n\nWe're launching impressive products, but the user experience is lacking. I challenge you to ask someone unfamiliar with crypto to open a Web3 site and try to decipher its purpose.\n\nWhile I may understand it, our goal should be to grow the industry, not just cater to the few who already grasp these concepts.\n\n### I'll conclude with some key points:\n\n**The right tool for the job**\n\nI'm sure most people think I hate React or Next.js as I complain about it so often. I will concede that I often complain to much without providing a solution to the issue. This is where things tend to get a bit complex as picking the correct tool for the job is paramount to a successful project.\n\nOver the past four months I have explored and built my website using the following platforms:\n\n- Next.js\n- Astro\n- Gastby\n- Svelt\n- NunJucks\n- WordPress\n- Craft\n- Webflow\n- Stemic\n\nI have mixed and matched the following headless CMS products with all core JavaScript frameworks:\n\n- Tina CMS\n- Sanity.io\n- WordPress\n- Contenful\n- Storyblok\n- Butter\n\n- Some projects do require it, but from my observations, it's necessary for about 45% or fewer.\n- Accessibility: We've failed to make Web3 inclusive, repeating the mistakes of Web2:\n  - Font sizes are too small.\n  - Contrast between elements is insufficient.\n  - ARIA roles are neglected.\n  - The dismissive attitude that \"blind people aren't trading crypto or using Web3\" exemplifies the mentality that has hindered Web3's progress for five years.\n- \"Performance doesn't matter.\"\n  - This statement is shocking. I could write a book on the importance of performance.\n  - Performance is crucial—if anyone tells you otherwise, end the conversation.\n\n> What I loved about Web2 is that we pushed web development forward. Desktop become responsive sites, we made so much progress. Now we seem fine with React and Tailwinds.\n\nWe need sites that put the user first and challenge the industry. Every Web3 front end is a carbon copy of the next. This is becoming the issue with Web3 sites connecting to wallets. The service provided it subpar, nobody seems to care. We have you’re money, we are the cool new project and you’ll get an airdrop.","src/content/blog/will-web3-become-a-reality.md","333e5ea60f1f1dab",{html:553,metadata:554},"<h3 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h3>\n<p></p><details><summary>Open Table of contents</summary><p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#the-web3-promise\">The Web3 Promise</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#whats-at-stake\">Whats at stake?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-only-solution\">The Only Solution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#if-this-is-true-why-hasnt-web3-seen-mass-adoption\">If this is true, why hasn’t Web3 seen mass adoption?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-else-is-wrong-with-web3\">What else is wrong with Web3?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#so-what-do-we-do\">So what do we do?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#do-you-have-an-example-of-a-good-project\">Do you have an example of a good project?</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#issues\">Issues:</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#remember-users-those-people-who-use-your-project\">Remember “Users”??

This is a fatal flaw akin to putting sqaure wheels on your car. It just doesn’t work and what makes this issue even worse is the quality of the projects following this paradigmn. Web3 is littered with poorly developed websites and dapps. Built by the cheapest labor a company can hire in order to rush projects out the door before the competition.</p>\n<p><strong>What happends when a project is rushed?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Branding is not thought through.</li>\n<li>Go to market is a race not well thought out process.</li>\n<li>Development is lackluster, leaving users frustred with broken projects and a user experience that was never planned or even discussed.</li>\n<li>Complex technical jargon is fun to those of us who understand it. This represents a small segement of users, the vast majoiry of potential users have no idea what all the technical jargon means. It’s very difficult for projects to take off when the vast majority of users have no idea how to use a product.</li>\n<li>Development for the sake of development. This really gets my blood pumping as this practice is moving us back to Web1. Is it cool we can build amazing things? Yes of course but is actually necessary for the project? My bet is its not. Only develop what is necessary for the project to work, introduce features when necessary not because you can.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list goes on but for the most part these are some of the biggest issues plaguing Web3 and preventing mass adoption.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what-do-we-do\">So what do we do?</h3>\n<p>Well this should be a no brainer. Slow down and make sure your project is built for the user and not the product or service. Web3 is for users, negletcing them in favor of building cool stuff your product is detremintal. Our goal is create a web that reduces friction between the user and project they are interacting with. Even the most advanced game changing project will fail if its to complex and difficult for a user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-you-have-an-example-of-a-good-project\">Do you have an example of a good project?</h3>\n<p>i’m so glad you asked. Lets take a look at some <strong>amazing</strong> projects that are doing things correctly. We’re going to break down what they are doing to help you create a project that moves Web3 forward not backwards.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"issues\">Issues:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Web3 Perception</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I recently completed my Marketing Mini-MBA, where Web3 was consistently mocked—not just by students, but also by industry leaders. It’s embarrassing to have Web3 ridiculed by classmates and instructors alike.</p>\n<p><strong>Are they right to laugh?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yes!</strong> Web3 is genuinely problematic, and I believe others must recognize this. While I appreciate the rapid pace of innovation and the influx of new projects, there are significant issues. With over 40 wallets and no <strong>easy</strong> central access point for Web3 content, users have become second-class citizens—a frightening development.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remember-users-those-people-who-use-your-project\">Remember “Users”?? Those people who use your project.</h3>\n<p>Users were once paramount; when treated well, they returned to your website. Web3 has taken the opposite approach: build as quickly as possible, using unnecessary tools, disregarding performance, and forgetting that not all users have 60-inch 4K screens with fiber internet.</p>\n<p>We’re launching impressive products, but the user experience is lacking. I challenge you to ask someone unfamiliar with crypto to open a Web3 site and try to decipher its purpose.</p>\n<p>While I may understand it, our goal should be to grow the industry, not just cater to the few who already grasp these concepts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ill-conclude-with-some-key-points\">I’ll conclude with some key points:</h3>\n<p><strong>The right tool for the job</strong></p>\n<p>I’m sure most people think I hate React or Next.js as I complain about it so often. I will concede that I often complain to much without providing a solution to the issue. This is where things tend to get a bit complex as picking the correct tool for the job is paramount to a successful project.</p>\n<p>Over the past four months I have explored and built my website using the following platforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Next.js</li>\n<li>Astro</li>\n<li>Gastby</li>\n<li>Svelt</li>\n<li>NunJucks</li>\n<li>WordPress</li>\n<li>Craft</li>\n<li>Webflow</li>\n<li>Stemic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have mixed and matched the following headless CMS products with all core JavaScript frameworks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tina CMS</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sanity.io</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>WordPress</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contenful</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Storyblok</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Butter</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some projects do require it, but from my observations, it’s necessary for about 45% or fewer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accessibility: We’ve failed to make Web3 inclusive, repeating the mistakes of Web2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Font sizes are too small.</li>\n<li>Contrast between elements is insufficient.</li>\n<li>ARIA roles are neglected.</li>\n<li>The dismissive attitude that “blind people aren’t trading crypto or using Web3” exemplifies the mentality that has hindered Web3’s progress for five years.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Performance doesn’t matter.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This statement is shocking. I could write a book on the importance of performance.</li>\n<li>Performance is crucial—if anyone tells you otherwise, end the conversation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I loved about Web2 is that we pushed web development forward. Desktop become responsive sites, we made so much progress. Now we seem fine with React and Tailwinds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We need sites that put the user first and challenge the industry. Every Web3 front end is a carbon copy of the next. This is becoming the issue with Web3 sites connecting to wallets. The service provided it subpar, nobody seems to care. We have you’re money, we are the cool new project and you’ll get an airdrop.</p>",{headings:555,imagePaths:587,frontmatter:588},[556,557,560,563,566,569,572,575,578,581,584],{depth:41,slug:42,text:43},{depth:45,slug:558,text:559},"the-web3-promise","The Web3 Promise",{depth:41,slug:561,text:562},"whats-at-stake","Whats at stake?",{depth:41,slug:564,text:565},"the-only-solution","The Only Solution",{depth:41,slug:567,text:568},"if-this-is-true-why-hasnt-web3-seen-mass-adoption","If this is true, why hasn’t Web3 seen mass adoption?",{depth:41,slug:570,text:571},"what-else-is-wrong-with-web3","What else is wrong with Web3?",{depth:41,slug:573,text:574},"so-what-do-we-do","So what do we do?",{depth:41,slug:576,text:577},"do-you-have-an-example-of-a-good-project","Do you have an example of a good project?",{depth:45,slug:579,text:580},"issues","Issues:",{depth:41,slug:582,text:583},"remember-users-those-people-who-use-your-project","Remember “Users”??
