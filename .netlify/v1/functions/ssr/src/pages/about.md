## Career Background

  - VWO
  - HotJar
  - MS Clarity
  - Google Looker

  - CrazyEgg
  - Google AdWords
    - Just about every PPC tool currently in use (Bing, Yahoo Ads, LinkedIn, etc)

- **Marketing**

  Having recently completed my Marketing MBA I have an excellent grasp on Marketing as a whole.

  - Content Creation
  - Brand Strategy
  - Building and Developing Brands from scratch.
  - Restructuring current Brand strategies that are not working.
  - Campaign Creation

- **Web Development**

I have a solid understanding of all the current JS frameworks, despite my personal preferences. I work with a variety of companies in different roles, often being called in to help correct a project that has gone off track.

This can be challenging, as company stakeholders may have fixed ideas about how to proceed.

In my current role, I debug, fix, document, and improve existing solutions. I also build out new solutions and act as a System Architect for companies looking to get off the ground.

**Why am I the best?**

- I focus on the user and how I can improve their experience.
- Performance is absolutely essential, and most companies and 3rd party contractors don't meet my standards.

- I returned to school in 2019 and received my Full Stack Web Development certificate from Case Western Reserve.
- I have valid qualifications in the following:
  - Google Analytics GA4
  - Google Core Web Vitals
  - Google Tag Manager
  - Google Looker

I excel at combining my marketing and web expertise to solve solutions or ideally prevent them before they break.
