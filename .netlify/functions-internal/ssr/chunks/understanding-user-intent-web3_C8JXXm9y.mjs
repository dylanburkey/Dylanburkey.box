Gerry McGovern’s talk at “An Event Apart” in Denver 2017 shines a much-needed spotlight on the best way to measure and improve the customer experience. McGovern presented a robust framework for tackling this issue, showcasing actionable strategies to streamline digital interaction. I was lucky enough to attend this event and left this talk with goosebumps. His honest, no bullshit speaking style takes on bloated web designs and delivers direct solutions for a more user-friendly experience that works in Web3’s rapidly expanding landscape.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I’ll break down the essential parts of McGovern’s insightful talk and point out how measuring the customer experience—and taking consistent action—can benefit your UX strategy in Web3. Here’s something to watch if you want to hear McGovern speak directly:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpMiMc1ErQ\"><strong>Click the photo or this text to watch the video. Fun with youtube API</strong></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpMiMc1ErQ\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/cdpMiMc1ErQ/sddefault.webp\" alt=\"Web3 User Experience\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdpMiMc1ErQ\"><strong>Click the photo or this text to watch the video. Fun with youtube API</strong></a></p>\n<p>McGovern is funny, engaging and can articulate the often stupid choices we as marketers, developers, designers and everyone else make daily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve never worked on a project where a company asked me to reduce content, build overly complex systems, or just keep adding features for the sake of development.\nIf you’ve been in a corporate environment, you know that <strong>if anyone spots any white space on a website, someone will want to fill it.</strong> It doesn’t matter what the solution is; that white space will be utilized!\nYou might find yourself in multiple meetings discussing how to address this white space. Sometimes, it even leads to collaboration across departments to find a solution. But here’s the thing: <strong>white space doesn’t always need a solution.</strong>\nit’s about real-world experience and data-driven decisions that translate into a better user journey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"using-videos-to-kickstart-engagement\">Using Videos to Kickstart Engagement</h3>\n<p>McGovern opened with humor and a video, instantly reminding us of the power of visual content. Videos are an effective tool to get people invested quickly. In his case, it wasn’t just to keep the audience awake—he used the video to highlight a core usability problem: how navigation works on websites and how users react to poor web design.</p>\n<p>Videos have long been known to engage and inform simultaneously, and digital designers working in Web3 should take note. Visual content is a quick way to show users important information and engage them at an emotional level. Use it wisely, though—an irrelevant video can distract or even irritate your users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"popularity-of-travel-content-can-we-trust-navigation-data\">Popularity of Travel Content: Can We Trust Navigation Data?</h3>\n<p>One of McGovern’s key points is how website owners can misinterpret user interactions without proper understanding of user intent. He highlighted how, on travel websites, many users focus too much on navigation, clicking around menus without completing their task. But is this good or bad?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Web statistics alone, like “clicks,” fail to explain why users >are clicking. More clicks don’t necessarily mean better engagement. If people are lost in a maze of navigation and aren’t finding what they need, then your site is failing, even if the metrics say otherwise. In Web3 UX, where users expect to interact with decentralized apps (dApps) and token-based ecosystems, navigation must be seamless, otherwise, trust—and engagement—drops quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-the-why-behind-user-actions\">Understanding the Why Behind User Actions</h3>\n<p>Metrics like time spent on a web page or number of clicks are easy to track, but they lack context. McGovern stresses that web performance needs to be paired with understanding user intent. In Web3, this translates to tracking not just what users are doing but <strong>why</strong> users aren’t completing their desired tasks efficiently.</p>\n<p>For instance, McGovern gave the example of someone trying to find travel documents for Canada, and instead of following the “ideal navigation path,” they were stalled by confusing options. Without knowing why people are clicking around or stalling, you’re left with incomplete information.</p>\n<p>This problem is magnified in Web3 applications. Users here are generally tech-savvy but impatient. If they’re spending undue time navigating or figuring out how to interact with a dApp, they’ll find alternatives—or not bother at all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"travel-to-canada-a-lesson-in-user-confusion\">Travel to Canada: A Lesson in User Confusion</h3>\n<p>McGovern masterfully broke down a specific task: finding out what documents an Irish citizen needs to visit Canada. The expected user journey, according to the Canadian government, should start with “Immigration.” However, most users clicked on “Travel,” assuming that’s where to find the information. This simple semantic difference resulted in wasted time and user frustration.</p>\n<p>A goal of Web3 platforms should be removing friction like this. When your platform has specific terminology or jargon (like “smart contracts” or “consensus mechanisms”), simplify it. Customers don’t want to spend precious minutes trying to interpret tech-speak. A smooth Web3 user experience should feature clear, direct terms that reflect how users think.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-eta-vs-visa-problem-clarity-is-key\">The ETA vs. Visa Problem: Clarity is Key</h3>\n<p>In McGovern’s example, users were further confused because the Canadian government referred to a travel authorization document as an eTA (Electronic Travel Authorization) instead of a visa. This kind of bureaucratic terminology caused extra stress for users who aren’t familiar with it. It’s a reminder that while internal teams may be familiar with certain terms, users operate on completely different assumptions.</p>\n<p>In Web3, this is a huge issue. Many Web3 platforms use complex terminology that confuses new users: gas fees, staking, slashing—terms that are crucial but need to be explained in a simple, intuitive way. If you want your Web3 app to attract mainstream users, it’s crucial to use language they understand, or at the very least, provide a quick and direct definition or explanation on the page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"useless-images-and-fancy-content-dont-be-distracting\">Useless Images and Fancy Content: Don’t Be Distracting</h3>\n<p>One of the best parts of McGovern’s talk is his hilarious takedown of useless web content. Using examples like unnecessary photos (planes, stock images of happy families), McGovern showed how many organizations waste the most valuable real estate on their web pages with irrelevant content.</p>\n<p>This applies to Web3 as well. Many sites rely on flashy visuals, excessive branding, or dense, technical copy. But do they really help the user accomplish what they need? Probably not. Relevancy is king. Get rid of the excess and make sure the content serves a purpose. For Web3, every interaction needs to lead towards the user’s goal, whether that’s minting a token, checking the status of a smart contract, or making a transaction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solving-problems-through-collaboration\">Solving Problems Through Collaboration</h3>\n<p>McGovern shared an example of how the Canadian government solved their navigation issues. Through collaboration between different departments—immigration and foreign affairs—they improved their web experience by bringing fragmented sections into a cohesive unit. By placing a crucial “Visit Canada” link where users would reasonably expect it (on the Travel page), the two departments came together to serve the user—rather than their own separate silos.</p>\n<p>This problem isn’t unique to the government. In decentralized Web3 projects, often multiple teams are working on different parts of the user experience. Smart contract developers may not have daily discussions with frontend engineers or UX designers. When everyone works independently, the result is a fragmented user experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"measuring-customer-experience-in-web3-success-rate-and-time-matter\">Measuring Customer Experience in Web3: Success Rate and Time Matter</h3>\n<p>McGovern makes an excellent point: to optimize your website—especially in Web3 where actions are often highly specific and task-driven—you need to track two key metrics: <strong>success rate</strong> (percentage of users completing a task) and <strong>time on task</strong> (how long it takes them to do it).</p>\n<p>Think about a wallet dApp. If a customer can’t figure out how to transfer tokens within a reasonable time, your product has failed, even if engagement metrics look fine on paper. Success rate and speed are the truest measures of UX efficiency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"case-study-simplicity-beats-innovation-in-canadian-passport-service\">Case Study: Simplicity Beats Innovation in Canadian Passport Service</h3>\n<p>McGovern shared a case from Canada’s passport service. In an attempt to be innovative, they introduced an interactive map with thousands of locations. The result? Users couldn’t figure out where to go and success rates plummeted. The simple fix? A basic box where users could input their postal code and get the nearest passport center. Success rates shot up to 100%.</p>\n<p>The lesson for Web3? Don’t overcomplicate things. Cool innovations are great, but they should never take priority over a smooth user experience. Token transfers, staking, and smart contract interactions should be as straightforward as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"focusing-on-core-tasks\">Focusing on Core Tasks</h3>\n<p>In his talk, McGovern emphasized a crucial point: keep it simple. Focus on core tasks. In Web3, this means getting users from point A to point B as quickly as possible. Whether it’s secure transfers, staking tokens, or voting in decentralized governance, the user’s key tasks should always be the focus.</p>\n<p>For instance, in a staking dApp, what do users want? Primarily, they want to know how to stake their tokens quickly, see the expected returns, and easily track rewards. Anything beyond that—features that aren’t directly related to that core function—is only extra noise. Offer it in simplified forms later, but when the user first arrives, make that core task a stress-free experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-power-of-links-and-task-based-design\">The Power of Links and Task-Based Design</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most revolutionary idea McGovern shared is the importance of correct links.
