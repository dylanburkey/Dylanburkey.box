The organization that my friend we worked with had a highly specific audience: users who were visually impaired. Our goal was not just to make it “usable” for them, but to ensure a truly inclusive and fully accessible experience. We carried our prior successes, our knowledge, and our confidence into the project. But we missed something critical.</p>\n<p>We thought we had created a player that would meet all accessibility standards. Technically, we had. But during the development process—and more importantly, during usability testing—we realized we had crucial gaps. The player was nearly accessible, but it was not <em>truly</em> inclusive.</p>\n<p>What we learned was humbling but transformation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"winning-the-contract-and-initial-setup\">Winning the Contract and Initial Setup</h2>\n<p>At the beginning, we had all the right ingredients for success. We won the contract largely because of our deep expertise in assessing and building accessible video players. We had already done detailed audits on various players and knew the technical requirements backwards.</p>\n<p>Our plan was to adopt a flexible, agile approach. We’d involve users in multiple phases and run frequent tests throughout development. It sounded like a winning formula, and in theory, it was.</p>\n<p>But soon, our assumptions began to unravel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-missing-controls-a-simple-assumption-gone-wrong\">The Missing Controls: A Simple Assumption Gone Wrong</h2>\n<p>One of the first decisions we made was to remove fast-forward and rewind buttons, thinking the timeline scrubber would suffice. We believed this choice would reduce clutter, simplifying interactions for screen reader users. It seemed like a small change, but in reality, this decision planted the seeds for a much larger problem.</p>\n<p>When we pushed the player out for usability testing, users with different disabilities—particularly those using older assistive technology—struggled. Someone testing the player through an older version of a screen reader found that the timeline scrubber wasn’t adjustable. Initially, we were baffled. We’d tested it rigorously in the most current versions. How could this problem have avoided our detection?</p>\n<p>What we missed was that not every user has access to the latest technology. Some people use outdated versions to navigate the web. So, while the timeline feature was theoretically accessible, it didn’t work for everyone. This was one of those failure moments that hurt the most, especially because we define ourselves as experts in accessibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"low-vision-users-a-missed-design-opportunity\">Low Vision Users: A Missed Design Opportunity</h2>\n<p>Another group that we initially overlooked were users with low vision. While the video player passed technical tests, the user experience was clunky for them. A problematic issue? The timeline scrubber. We realized that low-vision users couldn’t easily see the time markers that allowed precise navigation along the timeline. We assumed that moving the video to a specific time would be easy! But that assumption hadn’t considered how users with magnifiers or reduced fields of view engage with screen content.</p>\n<p>One user eloquently described the ordeal: They had to constantly guess where the 10-minute mark might be, move the scrubber, check the time at the left, and adjust again and again. Even with the best technical accessibility in place, the design failed to be intuitive for everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"redesigning-based-on-user-feedback\">Redesigning Based on User Feedback</h2>\n<p>We heard our users loud and clear. It was time to head back to the drawing board. First, we introduced a better timeline scrubber. We added a function that showed the current time as users moved along the timeline, putting it directly in their field of vision.</p>\n<p>Additionally, fast-forward and rewind buttons made a comeback after we realized how much they mattered, especially for users accustomed to these controls on VCRs and cassette players. It became evident that some users relied on these more than the scrubber. The fact that these buttons were missing caused unnecessary friction.</p>\n<p>What seemed like small design choices ended up creating major issues. Lesson learned: incremental improvements based on real-time feedback are <em>vital</em> in Web3 design processes. Inclusivity needs to factor into every step, not just the final product test.</p>\n<h2 id=\"practicing-true-inclusive-design-in-web3\">Practicing True Inclusive Design in Web3</h2>\n<p>One mistake anyone can make—and we made—is focusing only on technical accessibility.

If we’re willing to admit our mistakes, we create the perfect backdrop for growth and improvement. I’ve had my fair share of failures, but one particular experience while designing an accessible video player opened my eyes to areas I had previously overlooked in Web3 inclusive design.\n\n## Learning from Failure: The Video Player Case Study\n\nI was contracted to build a custom video player that would be an accessibility triumph. The organization that my friend we worked with had a highly specific audience: users who were visually impaired. Our goal was not just to make it \"usable\" for them, but to ensure a truly inclusive and fully accessible experience.

But during the development process—and more importantly, during usability testing—we realized we had crucial gaps. The player was nearly accessible, but it was not _truly_ inclusive.\n\nWhat we learned was humbling but transformation.\n\n## Winning the Contract and Initial Setup\n\nAt the beginning, we had all the right ingredients for success. We won the contract largely because of our deep expertise in assessing and building accessible video players. We had already done detailed audits on various players and knew the technical requirements backwards.\n\nOur plan was to adopt a flexible, agile approach.

Just because something complies with standards doesn’t mean it’s inclusive. In fact, inclusivity in Web3 design is multi-layered.\n\nThere are two levels of inclusive design:\n\n1. **Inclusion in the product.** This is what we commonly refer to as 'accessible design.'
